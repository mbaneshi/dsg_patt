### Book Title: 
**"Mastering Design Patterns: Practical Implementations in Java, Python, Rust, and TypeScript"**

### Book Prompt:

**Objective:** 
To create a comprehensive guide that explores the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns with practical, hands-on examples in four programming languages: Java, Python, Rust, and TypeScript. The book aims to demonstrate the relevance and application of these patterns in real-world software development.

   - Importance of design patterns in software architecture.
   - Overview of the Gang of Four and their contributions.

2. **Creational Patterns**
   - **Singleton**
     - Explanation and when to use it.
     - Real-world example in each language.
   - **Factory Method**
     - Benefits and implementation details.
     - Example scenarios in Java, Python, Rust, TypeScript.
   - **Abstract Factory**
     - Differences from Factory Method.
     - Practical applications across languages.

3. **Structural Patterns**
   - **Adapter**
     - Concept and use cases.
     - Implementation examples.
   - **Decorator**
     - How to enhance functionality dynamically.
     - Code snippets and explanations.
   - **Facade**
     - Simplifying complex subsystems.
     - Multi-language implementations.

4. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - **Observer**
     - Event-driven programming and notifications.
     - Examples in Java, Python, Rust, and TypeScript.
   - **Strategy**
     - Encapsulating algorithms for flexibility.
     - Code implementations.
   - **Command**
     - Encapsulating requests as objects.
     - Practical examples in real-world applications.

5. **Case Studies**
   - Building a sample application (e.g., e-commerce platform, task management tool) using design patterns.
   - Detailed walk-through of how various patterns are applied in the project.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Recap of the importance of design patterns.
   - Future trends and their evolving role in software design.
