**Summary:**
To add more design patterns to the book, consider including lesser-known or modern patterns, as well as variations on existing patterns. This expands the content and provides a broader educational perspective.

---

### Additional Design Patterns to Include:

1. **Additional Creational Patterns:**
   - **Builder:**
     - Useful for constructing complex objects step by step.
     - Implementations in all four languages with practical examples.
   - **Prototype:**
     - Create new objects by copying an existing object.
     - Discuss use cases where cloning is beneficial.

2. **Additional Structural Patterns:**
   - **Composite:**
     - Allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
     - Useful in scenarios like tree structures (e.g., file systems).
   - **Bridge:**
     - Decouple abstraction from implementation, enabling flexibility.
     - Explain its use in scenarios where multiple implementations exist.
   - **Proxy:**
     - Control access to an object, adding a layer of indirection.
     - Discuss security, lazy loading, and remote proxies.

3. **Additional Behavioral Patterns:**
   - **Mediator:**
     - Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
     - Useful for reducing dependencies between objects.
   - **State:**
     - Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
     - Implementations for state machines or workflow systems.
   - **Visitor:**
     - Separate an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates.
     - Useful for operations across heterogeneous object structures.

4. **Modern Patterns:**
   - **Microservices Patterns:**
     - Patterns like API Gateway, Service Discovery, and Circuit Breaker.
     - Discuss their relevance in building scalable distributed systems.
   - **Event Sourcing:**
     - Storing the state of a system as a sequence of events.
     - Applications in real-time systems and analytics.
   - **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**
     - Separate models for reading and writing data.
     - Useful in systems with complex read/write operations.

5. **Domain-Specific Patterns:**
   - **Dependency Injection:**
     - Managing dependencies through injection to promote loose coupling.
     - Examples in frameworks like Spring (Java) and Angular (TypeScript).
   - **Data Access Object (DAO):**
     - Abstracting and encapsulating all access to the data source.
     - Discussing ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) strategies.

6. **Combining Patterns:**
   - **Pattern Compositions:**
     - Discuss how multiple patterns can be used together.
     - Examples of common combinations (e.g., Strategy with Factory).
